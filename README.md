Requirements:
* staticfg and tabulate are strictly necessary, graphviz was used to visualize control flow and the results of my analysis

Contains:
* driver.py -- This script is the driver for the project. It can be run as is and will output warnings into the warnings folder.
* normal_flow.py -- This script is the main script which I refer to in the report.
* evalscripts -- This is the test suite which I generated using Cursor.
* test_script1.py -- This is my original script which I edited within to test the analysis initially. 
* evalscript*.py -- These are the two scripts which could not be turned into CFGs.
